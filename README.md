## 💡 Why I Built This

Most mental math tools today are:

- App-only and limited on desktop
- Filled with distractions or paywalls
- Missing serious customization for learners and educators

**Mental Math Trainer Pro** is my solution — a clean, fast, local-first math trainer with **full control**, designed to help users build accuracy, confidence, and speed in arithmetic without fluff.
